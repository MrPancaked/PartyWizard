Party wizard is a game development project for my software architecture cource at school. The goal of this project is to learn more about software architecture and programming design patterns. 
The focus was mostly on making decoupled, scalable systems. 
I very much enjoyed making this, and I love to see how easy implementing new features like enemies and spells is after putting some time into creating a proper system for them. 

Some Peaks into the development so far:
